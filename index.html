      Hi, I'm Kian, a student at UC Berkeley studying Mechanical Engineering.
      I'm interested in system control and autonomous design problems. Feel free to reach out!

    <h2>Autonomous Sailbot – Wind Energy Team</h2>
    <p>
      Research under Dr.Alam's TAFLAB group at UC Berkeley. The team developed a swarm of autonomous sailbot drones that
      could be controlled remotely and powered via renewable energy sources. I worked on the Wind Energy Conversion(WEC) 
      Team where we designed and fabricated turbine systems for power generation. More specifically, I worked on both 
      designing the models of wind turbines and its system parts like mount and connectors AND its electronic circuit. 
      You can read more about the project and group here:

    <h2>Robotic Arm</h2>
    <p>
      Designed, printed and wired a fully working 3D Printed robotic arm that tracked user's movements via 
      a webcam and gestured them back. This was a cheap project and an attempt to see how low cost we could make
      a robotic arm for educational endeavors. Most robotic projects are extremely expensive with complex microcontrollers
      and other components. By using only an Arduino and servos we created a great way to learn and introduce robotic
      concepts to everyone no matter their background. If you'd like to learn more about the project check this out:

    <h2>E-Bike Conversion</h2>
    <p>
      Converted a standard bicycle into an electric-assisted system with motor control
      and battery integration.

    <h2>Currency Denomination Reader</h2>
    <p>
      Built a currency denomination reader for the visually impaired as a class project in ENG 10 at De Anza College, 
      in partnership with Infineon Technologies. The project involved testing Infineon components and providing 
      user feedback throughout development. 
      
      The device uses a push-button connected to a Raspberry Pi and camera housed in a 3D-printed enclosure. 
      When a user places a bill inside and presses the button, the camera captures an image, which is processed 
      using OpenCV and compared against a library of known currency denominations. The system supports U.S., Canadian, 
      and British bills. 
      
      The goal of this project was to provide an accessible and low-cost solution for users—particularly in developing 
      regions—who may not have access to smartphones or advanced assistive technologies, helping them identify 
      currency safely and independently. Heres a video of the demo:

    <h2>Woodworking Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I love woodworking and I beleive it is what really helped me become a great engineer. At a young age my dad had
      me helping out around the house and yard building but more importantly getting comfortable making mistakes. 
      I learned the concept
